-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any change, such as the participation amount, the game wallet, or the
participation time window will be announced before a new game round starts,
and will be published through all channels.

It is highly desired to keep the values for as long as possible, as changes
cause uncertainty and break people's workflows (playflows).

It becomes necessary to change the game wallet address in cases such as
moving to a multi-sig wallet.

The participation amount may be changed later on in case it deviates too
strongly from the initial roughly one dollar value.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On GitHub pay attention to the timestamps when the specification files were
last modified, and the version history. These specification files are
supposed to be frozen, never changed, only superseded by a newer version
with a newer version number and a newer date if necessary!

By having the specifications published both on GitHub and on the website
karouzel.com (and possibly elsewhere) the players have a way to cross-check
the integrity of the data and system.
